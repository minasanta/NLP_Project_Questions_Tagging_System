# NLP_Project_Questions_Tagging_System

## Introduction

Sites that are specifically designed to have questions and answers for their users like Quora and Stackoverflow often request their users to submit five words along with the question so that they can be categorized easily. But, sometimes users provide wrong tags which makes it difficult for other users to navigate through. Thus, they require an automatic question tagging system that can automatically identify correct and relevant tags for a
question submitted by the user.
